<p>FORWARD (description)</p>
<hr />
<p>“If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radly would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble.  Knowing that Mr. Radley’s word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.”</p>
<p>“Boo wasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times.  It was all right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not a criminal.”</p>
<p>“‘You’re scared,’ Dill said, the first day.  ‘Ain’t scared, just respectful,’”</p>
<p>“‘Lemme think a minute ... it’s sort of like making a turtle come out...’ ‘How’s that?’ asked Dill. ‘Strike a match under him.’ ... ‘Ain’t hateful, just persuades him’”</p>
<p>“I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life”</p>
<p>“I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth.  In short, I was to leave him alone.”</p>
<p>“Atticus ain’t got time to teach me anything,”</p>
<p>“I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers.”</p>
<p>“Reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces.”</p>
<p>“Having never questioned Jem’s pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now.”</p>
<p>“The Cunninghams never took anything they can’t pay back–no church baskets and no scrip stamps.  They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have.  They don’t have much, but they get along on it.”</p>
<p>“I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us. ‘Not in money,’ Atticus said, ‘but before the year’s out I’ll have been paid.  You watch.’”</p>
<p>“‘Because that’s the only way he can pay me.  He has no money.’”</p>
<p>“Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor.  As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers.”</p>
<p>“Had her conduct been more friendly toward me, I would have felt sorry for her.”</p>
<p>“‘There’s some folks who don’t eat like us,’ she whispered fiercely, ‘but you ain’t called on to contradict ‘em at the table when they don’t.  That boy’s yo’ comp’ny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear?’”</p>
<p>“‘Don’t matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this house’s yo’ comp’ny, and don’t you let me catch you remarkin’ on their ways like you was so high and mighty!  Yo’ folks might be better’n the Cunninghams but it don’t count for nothin’ the way you’re disgracin’ ‘em–if you can’t act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen!’”</p>
<p>“‘I’ve no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever.  We couldn’t operate a single day without Cal, have you ever thought of that?  You think about how much Cal does for you, and you mind her, you hear?’”</p>
<p>“‘Let him go, ma’am,’ he said. ‘He’s a mean one, a hard-down mean one.  He’s liable to start somethin’, and there’s some little folks here.’”</p>
<p>“‘You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view–’  ‘Sir?’ ‘--until you climb into his skin and walk around in it’”</p>
<p>“‘Sometimes it’s better to bend the law a little in special cases.  In your case, the law remains rigid.  So to school you must go.’”</p>
<p>“‘It’s against the law, all right,’ said my father, ‘and it’s certainly bad, but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains.  I don’t know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit.’”</p>
<p>“‘If you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always have.  Is it a bargain?’”</p>
<p>“Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics.”</p>
<p>“No tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him [Jem] from getting at books.”</p>
<p>“I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something.  Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.”</p>
<p>“‘Don’t eat things you find, Scout.’”</p>
<p>“On my part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her.”</p>
<p>“Finders were keepers unless title was proven.”</p>
<p>“‘Lemonade time! You all get in outa that hot sun ‘fore you fry alive!’”</p>
<p>“He had thought that up to make me understand he wasn’t afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice.”</p>
<p>“I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, that’s why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play with.”</p>
<p>“Time spent indoors was time wasted.”</p>
<p>“She loved everything that grew in God’s earth, even the weeds.  With one exception.  If she found a blade of nut-grass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne.”</p>
<p>“‘Why can’t you just pull it up?’ ... ‘Pull it up, child, pull it up?’ She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk.  Microscopic grains oozed out.  ‘Why, one sprig of nut-grass can ruin a whole yard.  Look here.  When it comes all this dries up and the wind blows it all over Maycomb County!’”</p>
<p>“‘I know he’s alive, Jean Louise, because I haven’t seen him carried out yet.’”</p>
<p>“He was the last person in the world Miss Maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing, and the best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly.”</p>
<p>“‘Wouldn’t you stay in the house if you didn’t want to come out?’”</p>
<p>“‘You know old Mr. Radley was a foot washing Baptist–’ ‘That’s what you are, ain’t it?’ ‘My shell’s not that hard, child.  I’m just a Baptist.’ ‘Don’t you all believe in foot-washing?’ ‘We do. At home in the bathtub.’”</p>
<p>“‘Foot-washers believe anything that’s pleasure is a sin.  Did you know some of ‘em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell?’”</p>
<p>“‘They thought I spent too much time in God’s outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible.’”</p>
<p>“Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie.  She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our private lives.  She was our friend.  How so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible.”</p>
<p>“‘But sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of-oh, of your father’”</p>
<p>“‘If Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn’t be as hard as some men are at their best.  There are just some kind of men who–who’re so busy worrying about the next world they’ve never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results.’”</p>
<p>“‘Atticus don’t ever do anything to Jem and me in the house that he don’t do in the yard,’”</p>
<p>“‘Anybody who’s brave enough to go up and touch the house hadn’t oughta use a fishin’ pole,’ I said. ‘Why don’t you just knock the front door down?’”</p>
<p>“‘I’m going to tell you something and tell you one time: stop tormenting that man. That goes for the other two of you.’”</p>
<p>“If he wanted to come out, he would.  If he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children’”</p>
<p>“How would we like it if Atticus barged in on us without knocking, when we were in our rooms at night?  We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley.”</p>
<p>“‘Don’t light that thing, Dill, you’ll stink up this whole end of town.’”</p>
<p>“Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal.”</p>
<p>“‘Atticus ain’t ever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way.’”</p>
<p>“‘Don’t look ahead, Scout,’ Jem said. ‘Look at the ground and you won’t fall.’”</p>
<p>“‘And don’t you fret yourself about anything–why, if we followed our feelings all the time we’d be like cats chasin’ their tails.’”</p>
<p>“‘Low-down skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children.  He’d never have met you face to face.’”</p>
<p>“‘Mr. Finch, there’s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to ‘em.  Even then, they ain’t worth the bullet it takes to shoot ‘em.  Ewell ‘as one of ‘em.’”</p>
<p>“Even Boo Radley got sick sometimes, I thought.”</p>
<p>“People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions.”</p>
<p>“‘If this thing’s hushed up it’ll be a simple denial to Jem of the way I’ve tried to raise him.  Sometimes I think I’m a total failure as a parent, but I’m all they’ve got.’”</p>
<p>“‘I don’t want to lost him and Scout, because they’re all I’ve got.’”</p>
<p>“‘I can’t live one way in town and another way in my home.’”</p>
<p>“‘Honed it down and bided his time ... just bided his  time.’”</p>
<p>“‘Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch.  Let the dead bury the dead.’”</p>
<p>“‘Well, it’d be sort of like shootin’ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?’”</p>
<p>“Boo was our neighbor.  He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.  But neighbors give in return.  We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.”</p>
<p>“‘He was read nice...’ ... ‘Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’”</p>
<hr />
<p>I think <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> is full of wisdom and lessons that we can follow.  There are people who represent the attributes that we should strive for, and people who represent the traits we should avoid to adopt.  I liked how <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> showed the everyday lives of children and how innocent and curious they were; how they each were mischievous, but had a conscience, adventurous but thoughtful.  I like the drama conveyed in the story, and how some people contradict themselves.  I enjoyed how the author described the events in a matter-of-factly way instead of using overly flowery language to describe them.  I think this book shows basic principles that everyone needs to have.  It shows how experiences change people, and how each character learned through the book.  I think this book is not as good as some other books I have read, but at the same time it is also not the worst.  There is not much adventure, but it does have a lot of drama.  I think this book’s characters are believable.  They have real traits, and are relatable in more ways than one.  I am thankful that racism today is not as much of a problem today than it was during the time this book was written.  I would recommend that everyone should read this book, if not just to be aware of the bits of knowledge hidden within it.  Overall I liked this book, and will probably read it again in a few years.</p>
